# Input Macros Playback

This was a toy project that I first used to learn z3d hacking. This project has taken many forms, but the one shown here is a simple python script that generates a patch file. This might get updated with older versions if I can find where I buried those files / as I find my notes.

This project only requires Python 3 and not an actual C compiler. Just execute the python script to generate the ```code.ips``` file.
